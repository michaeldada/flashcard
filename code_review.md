* Is the Github documentation - commits and README - thorough and descriptive?

_Should probably add a README and maybe commit more granularly. Commit messages look good though_

* Is the code easy to read (good indentation, spacing, naming)?

_A little extra spacing and indentation on the first css category, but otherwise looks good. I like doing both toggles on one line in your js._

* Were jQuery effects used for user interaction?

_Yeah, looks good._

* Is the web page(s) styled using Bootstrap and CSS?

_Yes_

* Is the site user-friendly?

_Yes_

* Do you have any additional constructive criticism or positive feedback to share?

_Good job with styling into distinct flash cards with background colors and padding.
Maybe standardize flash card sizes if you get more time, but we had the same issue too._
